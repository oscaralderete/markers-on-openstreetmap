# markers-on-openstreetmap
New WordPress plugin to render a map with multiple markers using the open source maps provider OpenStreetMap

A friend of mine ask me to install my MultiMarkersOnGmap on hist site, but he hasn't a key nor know how to get a Google Maps key, so the only solution was modify that plugin and use the great and free OpenStreetMap alternative.

The plugin works fine, it has an admin zone that uses JavaScript reactivity wich is cool and modern (powered by my fav JS library: VueJS). No reloads, no page blinks; but the most important thing, no keys, no fees; thanks to the nive girls + guys that make possible OpenStreetMap exists.

The only thing you need to add this awesome plugin is create a shortcode:
```bash
[MarkersOnOpenStreetMap]
```
